		  	<h1>Personal Story <small>Section One</small></h1>
		  	<p>Define the problem better than your target customers and they will assume you have the solution. When the right people visit your page, you want them to know this page was created just for them. They have specific questions, you know the answers they’re looking for. Here is the content/value you’re looking for, I created it just for you. </p>

		  <div class="container">
		  	<h1>Goals <small>Section Two</small></h1>
		  	<p>They want to know how you can solve their problems. Cut through the fluff and let them know you can solve their problems by giving them the solution to their problems. Why should they use your services/product? What will they get out coming to your website? Explain the features benefits are XYZ. They can learn from you by what goes right or wrong. Also, don’t forget to mention on where to go to get started.</p>

		  <div class="container">
		  	<h1>References <small>Section Three</small></h1>
		  	<p>Show them you are the right person(credibility) to help them with their problems with proof. Proof can be testimonials, credentials, big name sites your content has been shared on, experience, or even images/video of you teaching others. This has much more power than talking about yourself and will give them additional reasons to trust you. You want to establish yourself as an authority in the field. Do not fake these, earn them. Your reputation is everything. If you are still learning, let them know this and share things as you discover them as well.</p>

		  <div class="container">
		  	<h1>Family <small>Section Four</small></h1>
		  	<p>Paint an honest picture of yourself and pretend you are telling someone about your business for the first time. Express that your personal mission on this project is their success. Include your personal story or experience to convey that message and align your values with theirs by sharing your past problems. Set yourself apart from the competition by revealing your personal unique selling point (not your business) and mention your stake in all of this. Keep it short and speak in plain English. Mention relevant achievements, but remember it’s not an autobiography. Don’t bore them.</p>

		  	<h1>Interests <small>Section Five</small></h1>
		  	<p>The newsletter opt-in forms are the most important part of your entire about me page. Include a minimum of 2 forms and make it easy to submit and continue reading. They should be able to include their first name, last name, and email address. Keep the first name and last name as separate fields. Make it clear that your newsletter series includes solutions to their problems. Provide examples of topics that are included. </p>
